## Welcome!
This is the land of Sanctum Team. Here we build and share open-source software for the things we care about!

### Contributing
We would love for you to help out on a project! Most, if not all public repositories will have one or more licenses at the project root.
If you contribute to a project, you accept that your contribution may be made available under the license(s) of the project, and that
you (or you acting for your organization) can make such contribution freely as the original author(s). The most common license for us
to use is the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0/); we currently do not use NOTICE files.

### Resources
#### Docs
Many projects have documentation either as static sites, wikis or a combination thereof.

We're working on an organization wiki right now. Check back in a bit!
#### Comms
We have a Discord where you can come for support, general questions, development help or just to hang out:

Discord: [HUB | Community](https://discord.gg/ykNnUnsZaF)

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
